- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on setting up this site! Still haven't decided what exactly to do with my page but I know I want to eventually showcase projects.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of stuff: R, github pgs, more technical stuff to make me a more competitive job seeker

- <a href="https://dispiritedraspberry.blogspot.com/">Personal blog</a> where I try to write down meaningful life happenings but not every post is insightful. Sometimes I just want to rant.
